# PIC12FXXX_dev
Simple PIC12FXXX development board with in circuit programming capability.

Detailed on my website here:
http://www.ianstedman.co.uk/Projects/PIC12FXXX_dev_board/pic12fxxx_dev_board.htm

his design was originally targeted at the 8 pin PIC12F629/12F675 devices. Microchip provide a number 8 pin devices using the same footprint, which should work with this board.
The author has recently started working with the smaller, 8 pin, PIC devices. To facilitate development it was decided to create a small development PCB, as an alternative to using a solderless breadboard. The design aims were as shown here:
 
Be capable of supporting the PIC12F675/12F629
In circuit programmable using the PICKIT2/3 programmer.
Be able to mechanically support the PIC12F675 ICD module.
Provide 2-4 switched inputs.
Provide LED outputs.
Small PCB.
Provide user access to GPIO pins and
Powered from a +5V supply.

Compatible 8 pin PIC micro-controllers
The author has not tested all these devices, they are listed here as they have a device pinout that matches the PCB
